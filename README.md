# Curlicue
An exploration of curlicue fractals.

As an amatuer mathematician, I've found it difficult to string together information pertaining to these fractals. This repo serves to coalesce information I've found, and to present my own findings (which could very well duplicate past mathematician's work, in which case, please let me know as I would love to learn more).

# What is a Curlicue Fractal?
There are varying definitions, as multiple approaches/formulas can generate what are described in literature as curlicue fractals. However, there is one common theme across these approaches.
